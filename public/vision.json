  {
    "question": "What does a computer actually see in a picture?",
    "options": ["Shapes and animals", "Words and meanings", "Tiny colored squares", "The whole photo at once"],
    "answer": "Tiny colored squares",
    "explanation": "A computer sees a grid of colored squares (pixels), not full pictures."

    "question": "What is 'classification' in AI?",
    "options": ["Drawing a picture", "Reading a sentence", "Guessing what an image is", "Saving a file"],
    "answer": "Guessing what an image is",
    "explanation": "Classification is when the computer says, 'This looks like a tree' based on features."

  {
    "question": "How does image classification help in farming?",
    "options": ["It waters the crops", "It takes photos of animals", "It identifies healthy and unhealthy plants", "It builds tractors"],
    "answer": "It identifies healthy and unhealthy plants",
    "explanation": "AI can classify images of crops to detect signs of disease or poor health, helping farmers take action quickly."
